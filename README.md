# The Story Behind Rubik's Table

I made Rubik's Table for my Programming Technology class during the fall of 2020.

This project was interesting for two reasons.

First off, I got to use Java in a way I had never used before because I had to use Swing to make a GUI, as opposed to just writing the output to the console.

Furthermore, I implemented a system that would solve the game by tracing back the steps that were done to mix the Rubik's-Cube-like table in the first place.

The experience I gained from this project would later help me with a more complex game, [Snake](https://github.com/ZoltanKuli/Snake).
